define text-analytics service that takes, as parameters,
-> function(text) { }
-> element to put the result into
-> categor(ies) to register hook under (so the editor can say things like "compute/update all the Length metrics" when opening Length collapsible)
-> stubbed >formatter(text) to format the resulting number before putting it into element

then just define all the metrics in a reusable file that notebook.ai can use also
